                <p>'Y'ou probably have a vague sense that exercise is good for you—and you’ve probably heard that it’s
                    “healthy for the
                    heart.” But if you’re like most people, that’s not enough motivation to get you to break a sweat
                    with any regularity. As
                    I report in the TIME cover story, “The Exercise Cure,” only 20% of Americans get the recommended 150
                    minutes of strength
                    and cardiovascular physical activity per week, more than half of all baby boomers report doing no
                    exercise whatsoever,
                    and 80.2 million Americans over age 6 are entirely inactive. <br>
                    That’s bad news, but emerging evidence shows that there are plenty of compelling reasons to start
                    moving at any age and
                    even if you’re ill or pregnant. Indeed, scientists are learning that exercise is, actually,
                    medicine. “There is no pill
                    that comes close to what exercise can do,” says Claude Bouchard, director of the human genomics
                    laboratory at Pennington
                    Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. “And if there was one, it would be extremely expensive.”

                    You can read the whole story for more, but here are some of the amazing things that happen to a body
                    in motion.

                <h3>1. Exercise is great for your brain.</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s linked to less depression, better memory and quicker learning. Studies also suggest that
                    exercise is, as of now,
                    the best way to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, a major fear for many Americans.

                    Scientists don’t know exactly why exercise changes the structure and function of the brain, but it’s
                    an area of active
                    research. So far, they’ve found that exercise improves blood flow to the brain, feeding the growth
                    of new blood vessels
                    and even new brain cells, thanks to the protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). BDNF
                    triggers the growth of
                    new neurons and helps repair and protect brain cells from degeneration. It may also help people
                    focus, according to
                    recent research.
                </p>

                <h4>2. You might get happier.</h4>
                <p>Countless studies show that many types of exercise, from walking to cycling, make people feel better
                    and can even
                    relieve symptoms of depression. Exercise triggers the release of chemicals in the brain—serotonin,
                    norepinephrine,
                    endorphins, dopamine—that dull pain, lighten mood and relieve stress. “For years we focused almost
                    exclusively on the
                    physical benefits of exercise and really have ignored the psychological and emotional benefits of
                    being regularly
                    active,” says Cedric Bryant, chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise.</p>

                <h4>3. It might make you age slower.</h4>
                <p>
                    Exercise has been shown to lengthen lifespan by as much as five years. A small new study suggests
                    that
                    moderate-intensity exercise may slow down the aging of cells. As humans get older and their cells
                    divide over and over
                    again, their telomeres—the protective caps on the end of chromosomes—get shorter. To see how
                    exercise affects telomeres,
                    researchers took a muscle biopsy and blood samples from 10 healthy people before and after a
                    45-minute ride on a
                    stationary bicycle. They found that exercise increased levels of a molecule that protects telomeres,
                    ultimately slowing
                    how quickly they shorten over time. Exercise, then, appears to slow aging at the cellular level.

                <h4>4. It’ll make your skin look better.</h4>
                <p>Aerobic exercise revs up blood flow to the skin, delivering oxygen and nutrients that improve skin
                    health and even help
                    wounds heal faster. “That’s why when people have injuries, they should get moving as quickly as
                    possible—not only to
                    make sure the muscle doesn’t atrophy, but to make sure there’s good blood flow to the skin,” says
                    Anthony Hackney, an
                    exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Train long enough, and
                    you’ll add more blood
                    vessels and tiny capillaries to the skin, too.

                    The skin also serves as a release point for heat. (See “Why Does My Face Turn Red When I Exercise?”
                    for more on that.)
                    When you exercise, your muscles generate a lot of heat, which you have to give up to the environment
                    so your body
                    temperature doesn’t get too high, Hackney says. The heat in the muscle transfers to the blood, which
                    shuttles it to the
                    skin; it can then escape into the atmosphere.</p>
                <h4>5. Amazing things can happen in just a few minutes.</h4>
                <p>Emerging research suggests that it doesn’t take much movement to get the benefits. “We’ve been
                    interested in the
                    question of, How low can you go?” says Martin Gibala, an exercise physiologist at McMaster
                    University in Ontario. He
                    wanted to test how effective a 10-minute workout could be, compared to the typical 50-minute bout.
                    The micro-workout he
                    devised consists of three exhausting 20-second intervals of all-out, hard-as-you-can exercise,
                    followed by brief
                    recoveries. In a three-month study, he pitted the short workout against the standard one to see
                    which was better. To his
                    amazement, the workouts resulted in identical improvements in heart function and blood-sugar
                    control, even though one
                    workout was five times longer than the other. “If you’re willing and able to push hard, you can get
                    away with
                    surprisingly little exercise,” Gibala says.</p>
                <h4>6. It can help you recover from a major illness.</h4>
                <p>Even very vigorous exercise—like the interval workouts Gibala is studying—can, in fact, be
                    appropriate for people with
                    different chronic conditions, from Type 2 diabetes to heart failure. That’s new thinking, because
                    for decades, people
                    with certain diseases were advised not to exercise. Now scientists know that far more people can and
                    should exercise. A
                    recent analysis of more than 300 clinical trials discovered that for people recovering from a
                    stroke, exercise was even
                    more effective at helping them rehabilitate.

                    Dr. Robert Sallis, a family physician at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center in California, has
                    prescribed exercise
                    to his patients since the early 1990s in hopes of doling out less medication. “It really worked
                    amazingly, particularly
                    in my very sickest patients,” he says. “If I could get them to do it on a regular basis—even just
                    walking, anything that
                    got their heart rate up a bit—I would see dramatic improvements in their chronic disease, not to
                    mention all of these
                    other things like depression, anxiety, mood and energy levels.”
                </p>
                <h4>7. Your fat cells will shrink.</h4>
                <p>
                    The body uses both carbohydrates and fats as energy sources. But after consistent aerobic exercise
                    training, the body
                    gets better at burning fat, which requires a lot of oxygen to convert it into energy. “One of the
                    benefits of exercise
                    training is that our cardiovascular system gets stronger and better at delivering oxygen, so we are
                    able to metabolize
                    more fat as an energy source,” Hackney says. As a result, your fat cells—which produce the
                    substances responsible for
                    chronic low-grade inflammation—shrink, and so does inflammation.
