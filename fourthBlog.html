                <p>'Y'ou've probably heard countless times how exercise is "good for you." But did you know that it can
                    help you feel good
                    too? Getting the right amount of exercise can rev up your energy levels and even help improve your
                    mood.

                <h3>Rewards and Benefits</h3>
                <p>
                    Experts recommend that teens get 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity each
                    day. Here are some of
                    the reasons:

                    Exercise benefits every part of the body, including the mind. Exercising causes the body to make
                    chemicals that can help
                    a person feel good. Exercise can help people sleep better. It can also help some people who have
                    mild depression and low
                    self-esteem. Plus, exercise can give people a real sense of accomplishment and pride at having
                    achieved a goal — like
                    beating an old time in the 100-meter dash.
                    Exercise helps people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases. Exercising regularly lowers a
                    person's risk of
                    developing some diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Exercise also
                    can help keep your
                    body at a healthy weight.
                    Exercise can help a person age well. This may not seem important now, but your body will thank you
                    later. For example,
                    osteoporosis (a weakening of the bones) can be a problem as people get older. Weight-bearing
                    exercise — like jumping,
                    running, or brisk walking — can help keep bones strong.
                    The three parts of a balanced exercise routine are: aerobic exercise, strength training, and
                    flexibility training.

                </p>

                <h4>Aerobic Exercise</h4>
                <p>Like other muscles, the heart enjoys a good workout. Aerobic exercise is any type of exercise that
                    gets the heart
                    pumping and gets you breathing harder. When you give your heart and lungs this kind of workout
                    regularly, they get
                    stronger and are better at getting oxygen (in the form of oxygen-carrying blood cells) to all parts
                    of your body.

                    If you play team sports, you're probably getting at least 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous
                    activity on
                    practice days. Some team sports that give you a great aerobic workout are basketball, soccer,
                    lacrosse, hockey, and
                    rowing.

                    But if you don't play team sports, don't worry — there are plenty of ways to get aerobic exercise.
                    These include biking,
                    running, swimming, dancing, in-line skating, tennis, cross-country skiing, hiking, and walking
                    quickly.
                </p>

                <h4>Strength Training</h4>
                <p>
                    The heart isn't the only muscle to benefit from regular exercise. The other muscles in your body
                    enjoy exercise too.
                    When you use your muscles, they become stronger.

                    Strong muscles are also a plus because they support your joints and help prevent injuries. Muscle
                    also use more energy
                    than fat does, so building your muscles will help you burn more calories and maintain a healthy
                    weight.

                    You don't have to lift weights to make your muscles and bones stronger. Different types of exercise
                    strengthen different
                    muscle groups, for example:

                    For arms, try rowing or cross-country skiing. Pull-ups and push-ups, those old gym class standbys,
                    are also good for
                    building arm muscles.
                    For strong legs, try running, biking, rowing, or skating. Squats and leg raises also work the legs.
                    For abdominal and core strength, you can't beat rowing, yoga or pilates, planks and crunches.

                <h4>Flexibility Training</h4>
                <p>Strengthening the heart and other muscles isn't the only important goal of exercise. Exercise can
                    also help the body
                    stay flexible, meaning that your muscles and joints stretch and bend easily.

                    Being flexible may also help improve a person's sports performance. Some activities, like dance or
                    martial arts, require
                    great flexibility. But increased flexibility also can help people perform better at other sports,
                    such as soccer or
                    lacrosse.

                    Sports and activities that encourage flexibility are easy to find. Martial arts like karate, ballet,
                    gymnastics, and
                    yoga are good choices. Stretching after your workout will also help you improve your flexibility.
                </p>
                <h4>What's Right for Me?</h4>
                <p>One of the biggest reasons people drop an exercise program is lack of interest: If what you're doing
                    isn't fun, it's
                    hard to keep it up. The good news is there are tons of different sports and activities to try to see
                    which one inspires
                    you.

                    When picking the right type of exercise, it can help to consider your workout personality. For
                    example, do you like to
                    work out alone and on your own schedule? If so, solo sports like running, biking, or snowboarding
                    could be for you. Or
                    do you like the shared motivation and companionship that comes from being part of a team? School
                    sports, intramural
                    leagues, club teams, and pick-up games are great ways to stay active with others.

                    You also need to plan around practical considerations, such as whether your chosen activity is
                    affordable and available
                    to you. (Activities like horseback riding may be harder for people who live in cities, for example.)
                    You'll also want to
                    think about how much time you can set aside for your sport.

                    It's a good idea to talk to someone who understands the exercise, like a coach or fitness expert at
                    a gym. He or she can
                    get you started on a program that's right for you and your level of fitness.

                    Doctors know that most people benefit from regular exercise, even those with disabilities or medical
                    problems like
                    asthma. If you have a health problem or other concern (like being overweight or very out of shape),
                    talk to your doctor
                    before beginning an exercise plan.

                    Considering the benefits to the heart, muscles, joints, and mind, it's easy to see why exercise is
                    wise. And the great
                    thing about exercise is that it's never too late to start. Even small things can count as exercise
                    when you're starting
                    out — like taking a short bike ride, walking the dog, or raking leaves.
