                <p>'Y'ou already know that exercise is good for your body. But did you know it can also boost your mood,
                    improve your sleep,
                    and help you deal with depression, anxiety, stress, and more?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="secondParaghraph">
                <h3>What are the mental health benefits of exercise?</h3>
                <p>
                    Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure, exercise can improve your
                    physical health and your
                    physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to your life. But that’s
                    not what motivates
                    most people to stay active.

                    People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being.
                    They feel more
                    energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed
                    and positive about
                    themselves and their lives. And it’s also a powerful medicine for many common mental health
                    challenges.

                    Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, and ADHD. It also
                    relieves stress,
                    improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts your overall mood. And you don’t have to be a
                    fitness fanatic to
                    reap the benefits. Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a real difference. No
                    matter your age or
                    fitness level, you can learn to use exercise as a powerful tool to deal with mental health problems,
                    improve your energy
                    and outlook, and get more out of life.
                </p>

                <h4>Exercise and depression</h4>
                <p>Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant
                    medication—but without
                    the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
                    Public Health found
                    that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by
                    26%. In addition to
                    relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent
                    you from relapsing.

                    Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all
                    kinds of changes in the
                    brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote
                    feelings of calm and
                    well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits
                    and make you feel
                    good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to
                    break out of the cycle
                    of negative thoughts that feed depression.</p>

                <h4>3. It might make you age slower.</h4>
                <p>
                    Exercise has been shown to lengthen lifespan by as much as five years. A small new study suggests
                    that
                    moderate-intensity exercise may slow down the aging of cells. As humans get older and their cells
                    divide over and over
                    again, their telomeres—the protective caps on the end of chromosomes—get shorter. To see how
                    exercise affects telomeres,
                    researchers took a muscle biopsy and blood samples from 10 healthy people before and after a
                    45-minute ride on a
                    stationary bicycle. They found that exercise increased levels of a molecule that protects telomeres,
                    ultimately slowing
                    how quickly they shorten over time. Exercise, then, appears to slow aging at the cellular level.

                <h4>Exercise and anxiety</h4>
                <p>Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts
                    physical and mental
                    energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Anything that gets you moving can
                    help, but you’ll
                    get a bigger benefit if you pay attention instead of zoning out.

                    Try to notice the sensation of your feet hitting the ground, for example, or the rhythm of your
                    breathing, or the
                    feeling of the wind on your skin. By adding this mindfulness element—really focusing on your body
                    and how it feels as
                    you exercise—you’ll not only improve your physical condition faster, but you may also be able to
                    interrupt the flow of
                    constant worries running through your head.</p>
                <h4>Exercise and stress</h4>
                <p>Ever noticed how your body feels when you’re under stress? Your muscles may be tense, especially in
                    your face, neck, and
                    shoulders, leaving you with back or neck pain, or painful headaches. You may feel a tightness in
                    your chest, a pounding
                    pulse, or muscle cramps. You may also experience problems such as insomnia, heartburn, stomachache,
                    diarrhea, or
                    frequent urination. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even
                    more stress,
                    creating a vicious cycle between your mind and body.

                    Exercising is an effective way to break this cycle. As well as releasing endorphins in the brain,
                    physical activity
                    helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body. Since the body and mind are so closely
                    linked, when your
                    body feels better so, too, will your mind.</p>
                <h4>Exercise and ADHD</h4>
                <p>Exercising regularly is one of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce the symptoms of ADHD and
                    improve
                    concentration, motivation, memory, and mood. Physical activity immediately boosts the brain’s
                    dopamine, norepinephrine,
                    and serotonin levels—all of which affect focus and attention. In this way, exercise works in much
                    the same way as ADHD
                    medications such as Ritalin and Adderall.

                <h4>7. Your fat cells will shrink.</h4>
                <p>
                    The body uses both carbohydrates and fats as energy sources. But after consistent aerobic exercise
                    training, the body
                    gets better at burning fat, which requires a lot of oxygen to convert it into energy. “One of the
                    benefits of exercise
                    training is that our cardiovascular system gets stronger and better at delivering oxygen, so we are
                    able to metabolize
                    more fat as an energy source,” Hackney says. As a result, your fat cells—which produce the
                    substances responsible for
                    chronic low-grade inflammation—shrink, and so does inflammation.
                </p>
                <h4>Exercise and PTSD and trauma</h4>
                <p>Evidence suggests that by really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise, you can
                    actually help your
                    nervous system become “unstuck” and begin to move out of the immobilization stress response that
                    characterizes PTSD or
                    trauma. Instead of allowing your mind to wander, pay close attention to the physical sensations in
                    your joints and
                    muscles, even your insides as your body moves. Exercises that involve cross movement and that engage
                    both arms and
                    legs—such as walking (especially in sand), running, swimming, weight training, or dancing—are some
                    of your best choices.

                    Outdoor activities like hiking, sailing, mountain biking, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, and
                    skiing (downhill and
                    cross-country) have also been shown to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.</p>
