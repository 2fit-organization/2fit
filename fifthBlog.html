                <p>'E'xercise snacking differs from HIIT in both the duration of the activity burst and the time in
                    between. Whereas the
                    exercise bursts in HIIT can range from 30 seconds to four minutes, in exercise snacking, these are
                    reduced to 20
                    seconds.

                    The effect of these snacks on fitness was tested in a study of 28 inactive adults. Those randomized
                    to doing three
                    20-second bike sprints separated by one to four hours of inactivity, three times per day for three
                    days per week
                    experienced a nine per cent improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness. This was comparable to the 13
                    per cent improvement
                    in the group that conducted the three 20-second bike sprints over a 10-minute period.

                    Now this doesn’t mean going to the gym for a minute several times per day, or needing your own home
                    gym. Or even getting
                    into spandex. The beauty of exercise snacks is that you don’t need any equipment. Even climbing
                    three flights of stairs,
                    three times per day, three days per week for six weeks resulted in a modest increase in fitness in
                    non-exercisers. This
                    small amount of activity is enough to improve insulin metabolism in people who are overweight,
                    confirming earlier
                    research indicating two minutes of moderate walking every 20 minutes reduces blood sugar following a
                    high-sugar test
                    drink.

                <h3>Fitting in your daily snacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Exercise snacking isn’t new, although the research and the term are. If you’ve ever been sitting at
                    your computer or
                    watching TV and had the urge to stand up and walk around or stretch, you’ve had an exercise snack.
                    This type of body and
                    brain break is famous among many writers. Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code, spends a minute
                    every hour when
                    writing doing push-ups and sit-ups. And why not? Short bursts of exercise can give you an energy
                    boost and improve your
                    productivity.
                    <img id="mainImage" src="./Image/wesley-tingey-57wo9F-r2-A-unsplash.jpg" alt="">

                    What makes the exercise snack different from standing up and stretching or walking to the kitchen,
                    is increasing your
                    heart and breathing rates. But you don’t need to worry about sweating. Moving about for one to two
                    minutes isn’t enough
                    time for you to start. This is makes it easy to do in everyday clothes.

                    Some activities you can do include stair climbing, jogging in place, jumping jacks and burpees. You
                    can even do a brisk
                    walk or jog around the block. If you have a stationary bike or rowing machine, just jump on that for
                    a minute or so.
                    If you want something of longer duration, there’s the Royal Canadian Air Force 11-minute workout
                    plan. Developed in
                    1959, you can do this program at home without any equipment (although keeping your knees bent during
                    sit-ups is
                    advisable). Researchers recently studied a modified version of this program, and found it effective
                    at improving
                    fitness.

                    It’s still ideal to get in your regular meal of exercise as well as your snacks. But exercise snacks
                    are a great way to
                    build activity into your day.

                    If you think you’ll have a hard time remembering to get up every so often, technology can help. From
                    a simple cooking
                    timer, to the alarm on your phone, to watches that vibrate reminding you to get up. But perhaps the
                    most effective may
                    be using a screen time app on your computer, tablet or phone. Some of these apps lock out your
                    device for a set period
                    of time, giving you the impetus to get up and move.
