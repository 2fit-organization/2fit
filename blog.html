                <p>'I'gnore bad fitness advice to make the most out of your time at the gym. <br>
                    You can’t walk into a gym these days without hearing someone spout “surefire” exercise tips. But
                    with all the bad advice
                    floating around, teasing out the effective training tips from the fitness myths can be more
                    difficult than getting
                    through a grueling workout. To help you sort fitness fact from fiction, here is some of the most
                    common fitness advice
                    that doesn’t work — along with expert tips that do

                <h3>Bad advice: Crunches are the best way to burn belly fat.</h3>
                <p>
                    The reality: “Crunches cause your abdominal muscles to contract, which will increase their strength
                    and endurance, [but]
                    crunches burn very few calories,” says Michele Olson, PhD, a professor of exercise science at the
                    Human Performance
                    Laboratory at Auburn University at Montgomery in Alabama. You need to burn 3,500 calories to lose
                    just 1 pound of fat,
                    and doing 50 or more crunches won’t even come close to burning that much. A better workout tip: “A
                    flat abdominal area
                    with little fat covering the muscles requires a combined effort from an appropriate diet and other
                    calorie-burning
                    workout activities like jogging or spinning classes,” Olson says. The takeaway? Combine cardio with
                    ab-strengthening
                    exercises and a healthy diet, and you'll have a flat belly in no time.

                <h4>Bad advice: A long treadmill run is the best workout.</h4>
                <p>
                    The reality: Variety is the mark of a good workout, not hours spent doing the same thing. “Mix it
                    up,
                    even in the same
                    workout,” says Michael Maina, PhD, an associate professor of health and human performance at Roanoke
                    College in Salem,
                    Va. “Spend five minutes on the treadmill, five minutes on the stair climber, and five minutes on a
                    rowing machine.” A
                    varied workout is more motivating, and you’ll gain extra benefits by changing up the muscle groups
                    you’re working.</p>

                <h4>Bad advice: Working out in extreme heat burns more calories and fat than the same activity in a
                    lower temperature.</h4>
                <p>
                    The reality: Hot yoga might be all the rage, but that doesn’t mean these workouts are high-octane
                    calorie burners. “You
                    will burn the same number of calories doing a series of sun salutations or other yoga moves
                    regardless of the
                    temperature of your environment,” Olson says. “Fitness and calorie expenditure come from moving your
                    body weight against
                    gravity. The resistance from gravity does not change the intensity of your workout when temperatures
                    change.”

                <h4>Bad advice: All you need for a complete exercise program is cardio and weights.</h4>
                <p>The reality: “Fitness is actually measured in five dimensions: strength, speed, agility, endurance,
                    and flexibility,”
                    says certified personal trainer Amanda L. Ebner, MA, MEd, a FitOrbit.com Top 10 Trainer. “If you
                    focus only on the
                    old-fashioned cardio-and-weights duality, you will miss out on some amazing workout alternatives,
                    such as power lifting
                    (strength), high-intensity interval training (speed), team sports (agility), marathon/triathlon
                    training (endurance),
                    and yoga (flexibility).” Among her tips: Try to identify the areas of fitness in which you are
                    weakest and take up a
                    workout activity targeted at building those missing skills.</p>
                <h4>Bad advice: Weight machines prevent injuries better than free weights.</h4>
                <p>The reality: “Weight machines are generally designed based on the dimensions of the average-sized
                    male, which can place
                    your knees, back, and shoulders into positions where muscles are not pulling at the proper angle,”
                    Olson says. “This can
                    harm your joints.” She adds that one advantage of using free weights for the strength-training
                    portion of your workout
                    is that you can lift, press, and curl them with your natural range of motion. Another tip: “Free
                    weights also engage
                    more of your spine-supporting core muscles and help improve balance, preventing common lifestyle
                    muscle pulls, joint
                    strain, and falls,” she says.</p>
                <h4>Bad advice: No pain, no gain.</h4>
                <p>The reality: No reliable fitness tip should advocate true pain as part of workout success. “There is
                    a difference
                    between being a little sore and being injured,” Maina says. “You should feel a slight fatigue or
                    mild discomfort
                    following a good workout, but you shouldn’t feel so sore that it affects your daily functioning.”
                </p>
                <h4>Bad advice: Static stretching will always prevent injuries.</h4>
                <p>
                    The reality: “Stretching cold muscles, tendons, and ligaments can actually harm them since they are
                    relatively stiff to
                    begin with,” Olson says. “Instead, warm up your muscles at the beginning of a workout by doing
                    dynamic movements, such
                    as walking briskly for five minutes, performing half-squats with just your body weight, and marching
                    with high knees.
                    These activities will increase circulation of oxygen-rich blood to your muscles and literally warm
                    them — increase their
                    metabolism, which produces heat. Save static stretching for the cooldown part of your workout, when
                    your muscles are
                    very warm and extensible.”
